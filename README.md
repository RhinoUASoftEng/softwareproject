The project is intended to be a lightweight counter to Quickbooks that will be scalable and modular so as to provide exact functionality as required by the users. This will be accomplished using custom server software developed by the team for interacting with a PostgreSQL database and Android driven apps. Later functionality will include iOS and desktop support for greater functionality.
